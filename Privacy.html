We do not collect any personal identifiable information about LetterHunter users. The game can be downloaded and played anonymously without creating an account.
The only information we collect relates to your use of the application, such as gameplay metrics, usage statistics, aggregated analytics, and bug reports. These do not identify individual users.<br>

Information may be shared internally or with third party analytics services to assist with improving the application. All data shared is anonymized and does not contain personal identifiable information.
We will never sell personal information to third parties or marketers.<br>

Children’s Privacy<br>
LetterHunter does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13. The game is intended for children ages 6-10 to have fun while learning.
If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us information without parental consent, it will be immediately deleted. We encourage parents to instruct their children to never provide personal information online without their permission.<br>
